Perception

Warm bowl of soup

Brain -> Touch -> Warm -> Pos:Hands

Brain -> Smell -> Pleasant -> Composition:Related to Taste

Brain -> Vision -> 2x images (not perfect, focus in middle) -> Story(from Focus) -> Composition:Discard everything but story

Brain -> Hearing -> Soup (preceding: bubbling boiling water) -> Slurping noises

Brain -> Taste -> somwhat from smell, main from taste



# First of all it is impossible to represent the world via information, to have a 1:1 model we would need to replicate reality 1:1, meaning we would literally need to replicate everything happening and store the same amount of information.

# So we will focus on the scope of our application: in the provided example we want to encapsulate something akin to a story told by our senses, so I decided to use the 5 senses as the primary classes, inherited from Brain, to efficiently represent what matters within our scope.

# Time is crucial in this model, as perception occurs over time, so a series of event could be a way to store the entire experience (experience class?)

# Certain invading senses (ex. a barking dog) can attract focus, especially of the eyes, that focus exactly on the point of interest 

# world -> perception -> change things via actions -> new perception

# ai integration -> create a story from a sequence of simple (random?) events, decide action sequence

# variable length sequence
# prompt for random perception -> prompt for action based on perception dict -> repeat

# at the end construct story (from simple one two word phrases recorded in sequence of events) and prompt a bigger LLM to give you a story

# record simple 1-2 word phrases sequence based on focus in reality and do the same

# go on walk -> record while walking -> say out loud what is happening, no, what you see, no wha you focus is on (5 senses tied) in short sentences -> write a story about what happened on the walk without looking at log of events -> give log of events to workflow -> compare stories

# 2d map walk simulate with 2d objects with properties and actions, route and house and streets etc...

# compare route and sequence of events to story told by AI based on focus log

# in 3d would be foxu circle of vision each 200ms, walking forward, eyes forward
